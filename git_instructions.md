`git init`
`git add remote -t \* -f origin https://github.com/knotebooklm/rag-service.git`
`git checkout main`

Now commit individual files with descriptive commit messages.
`git add <filename(s)>`
`git commit -m "<commit message>`

Now write the README. Explain what the RAG service is, what it will interface with, how it's organized, how it works (e.g., what libraries it uses)

Finally, create a pull request
